# Boids
A simple [Boids](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/) simulation coded using '[Python Playground](https://nostarch.com/pythonplayground)' written by Mahesh Venkitachalam.

Requires importing matplotlib, numpy, scipy.spatial.distance.

Code has been altered in such a way that the default axes created by matplotlib has been hidden to give it better aesthetics.
